1.1     What is FF3j?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Fantasy IIIj is the japanese Final Fantasy III, released for the
Famicom (known as NES in North America).  The j differentiates the name
from Final Fantasy III, a North American SNES game.  This chart describes
the differences:

Key:    NES: Nintendo Entertainment System
	SNES: Super Nintendo Entertainment System
	FAM: Nintendo Famicom (Japanese NES)
	SFAM: Super Famicom   (Japanese SNES)
	PSX: Sony Playstation

North America           Japan
---------------------------------------------
Final Fantasy 1 (NES)   Final Fantasy 1 (FAM)
*Not released           Final Fantasy 2 (FAM)                
*Not released           Final Fantasy 3 (FAM)
Final Fantasy 2 (SNES)  Final Fantasy 4~(SFAM)
*Not released           Final Fantasy 5 (SFAM)
Final Fantasy 3 (SNES)  Final Fantasy 6 (SFAM)
Final Fantasy 7 (PSX)   Final Fantasy 7 (PSX)

(Note: Titles designated with an asterisk (*) are planned for a north
       american release by Square, but nothing decisive has been 
       confirmed.  The tilde (~) on FF4 designates that it is   
       substantially different from the North American Version. See
       the Final Fantasy IV faq for more information.)  
       
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2     What Final Fantasy is 3j most like?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Fantasy 3j is most like Final Fantasy I and V. Characters are named,
classes are chosen, etc.  However, it is also the start of many Square
trademarks.

-Moogles make their first appearance; relatively untouched compared
 to their FFV/VI followers.

-Chocobo's are available in two types: White (for movement) 
 and Fat (for storage). 

-The Debut of several mainstay classes like Dragoon's and Caller's. 
 (Note: Richard of FFIIj was a Dragoon, but nothing differentiated 
 him from any of the other non-Dragoon characters.)
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------        
1.3     What/Where can I get FF3j?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Fantasy 3j (FF3j) was originally made for the famicom.  However,
due to the extreme age of this title, it has become extremely rare.  

Recently, several new platforms have popped up for playing this title. 
Supposedly, Square plans to release it on the Sony Playstation. Also,
it is available for NES emulators, although the legality of such things
are null...zero...nada.  If you recognize these legal issues, but still 
wish to take it on, several internet sites carry both the full japanese 
version and a partially translated version for those who are not 
japanese-literate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4     What Emulators?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emulators are computer programs that are programmed to 'behave' like
your video game system (in this case).  By using quasi-legal rom
dumping hardware to put the .rom file on a computer, it becomes
possible for the emulators to play games.  Legal or not, there
are sites on the internet that carry these games.  
With this in mind, I nor any other FAQ I know of
will let you know the location of these sites.  Find it yourself!

			
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5     What is this "Translated" FFIIIj I hear about?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A group of people on the internet (who shall remain nameless
	unless they ask otherwise) have managed to alter a copy
	of the FFIIIj rom.  The alteration they have performed has in
	fact translated a great deal of the game.

	Translated:     Class Names
			Stat Screen words
			Weapon Names (89%)
			Armor Names  (80%)
			Item Names   (99%)
			Magic Names  (87%)
			Text         (2%)

	Why is the whole game not translated?  
	
	In many ways,
	the english language is much bigger than the japanese
	language.  While it may take 4 letters for the word 
	"Boom", the same word can be usually be accomplished
	with one japanese symbol.  One symbol is worth the same
	in terms of file space as one letter of the english 
	alphabet, so a lot more space is usually needed for 
	translations.
	
       -But I surely have enough hard drive space.  Why can't
	it all fit?
	
	ROM's have a special
	code inbedded in them so the ROM can check its file size
	when in use.  If the file size is wrong, the ROM realizes
	it is damaged and will not work.  While this is fine for
	cartridges, its a problem for emulators that cannot yet
	be avoided.   

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1     What are the classes (jobs) available in FF3j?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weapon Type:Type of equippable weapon
Armor Rank: Weak (cant equip much) Medium (so so) and Strong (lots)
Commands:   Available battle commands  
Strengths:  Level up and stat strong points
Special:    Special ability
Use:        Recommended use
  
  
  Onion Kid
-------------
Weapon Type: Sword/Knife
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Parry/Run/Item
Strengths:   none
Special:     They can equip crystal armor.
Use:         Upgrade ASAP.  These guys suck like no other!

   Fighter
-------------
Weapon Type: Sword
Armor Rank:  Strong
Commands:    Fight/Parry/Run/Item
Strengths:   Attack Power/Defense/HP
Special:     None
Use:         Forget about shields and put a sword in
	     each hand.  Battles are much easier that
	     way.

   Knight
-------------
Weapon Type: Sword
Armor Rank:  Strong
Commands:    Fight/Parry/Run/Item
Strengths:   Attack Power/Defense/HP
Special:     Guard -protects other party members when they are weak
Use:         Dual Swords make for a happier soldier. Also take note
	     that only the Knight can hold the legendary "Excalibur".

   Paladin (Mystic Knight)
-------------
Weapon Type: Katana/Boomerang
Armor Rank:  Strong
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Parry/Item
Strengths:   Attack/Magic/HP
Special:     Lv. 1-3 White Magic
Use:         Double up the Katana's...They will not duplicate
	     later enemies. Boomerangs are also effective.

 Monk
-------------
Weapon Type: Fists/Nunchucks
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Parry/Run/Item
Strengths:   Attack/HP
Special:     Fists results in up to 50x hits as skill increases.
Use:         Nunchucks only decrease attack power. Use Fists.

Karate Master
-------------
Weapon Type: Fists/Nunchucks/Claws
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Keep/Parry/Item
Strengths:   Attack/HP
Special:     Keep:  Master saves up attack energy for one round.
		   While saving, defense is 0, but when attack
		   unleashed, 2x attack power is given.  This
		   technique can be used twice in a row; 
		   subsequent charges in a row will blow the
		   energy up in your face for a loss of about
		   1/2 your HP.
Use:         Double up the Claws!  Keep him in the back row
	     if he cant kill very easily.  If your level is high
	     enough however, remember that fists might 
	     be more effective.

    Thief
-------------
Weapon Type: Knives
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Steal/Flee/Item
Strengths:   Agility
Special:     Flee is a higher percent version of Run.  Also,
	     Thieves, when they are the visible character, can
	     open doors that normally only a magic key can unlock.
	     The use of Steal is obvious. Use it to steal various things 
	     from enemies.
Use:         Double up the knives, have him stealing when thats not 
	     enough, and have him use flee frequently when in toad
	     or small form.

    Ninja
-------------
Weapon Type: All Weapons
Armor Rank:  Great!! Can use all armor
Commands:    Fight/Parry/Run/Item
Strengths:   Agility/Escape
Special:     He can use everything.  What else do you need?
Use:         Later in the game...equip him with Shuriken.
	     Double up and fire away for 5000+ damage.  You can
	     equip new ones during battle without turn penalty.

    Sage
-------------
Weapon Type: Books
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   Magic
Special:     Lv.1-8 Black/White/Call Magic   
Use:         These guys rock.  They hold everything! Stock them   
	     up with Call magic before adding black and white.  Why
	     not change all your magicians to this class?  Because
	     they are not specialized, their magic is not as effective
	     as pure white or black wizards.

  Red Mage
-------------
Weapon Type: Swords/Knives
Armor Rank:  Medium
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   HP/Magic
Special:     Level 1-4 Black or White Magic
Use:         Put together your favorite arsenal, as the combination
	     of black and white magic makes him a force to be reckoned
	     with....for awhile.

   Scholar
-------------
Weapon Type: Books
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Peep/Peer/Item
Strengths:   none
Special:     Peer lets you spy on the strengths/weaknesses of enemies.  
	     Peep is the same as -Peep- Magic.
Use:         Not very effective for fighting...he is best only for
	     keeping tabs on enemies. Peer is VERY important for the 
	     battle with the Wizard Hyn, according to one of my sources.
	     Nothing wrong with blundering through like I did though.

 White Mage
-------------
Weapon Type: Staff
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   Magic
Special:     White Magic Lv.1-7
Use:         For most of the game, white mages hold you in the game 
	     with their healing powers.  Always keep them well stocked
	     with magic.

 White Wizard
-------------
Weapon Type: Staff
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   Magic
Special:     White Magic Lv.1-8
Use:         Upgrade to this class ASAP.  While you can't
	     get Lv. 8 magic until the Crystal Tower, they
	     will offer you enhanced skills and magic uses, and they 
	     have more MP.

 Black Mage
-------------
Weapon Type: Knives/Rod
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   Magic
Special:     Black Magic Lv.1-7
Use:         These guys sure are handy!  Loads of evil magic
	     to rain on your opponents...just keep their magic
	     up to date.

 Black Wizard
-------------
Weapon Type: Rod
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   Magic
Special:     Black Magic Lv.1-8
Use:         2 words.  Flare and Meteo.  They hit hard, and they
	     hit fast.  The power of nuclear energy is not to
	     be ignored; so get it!

    Hunter 
---------------
Weapon Type: Bow/Arrows
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Parry/Item
Strengths:   Magic, Fighting
Special:     Level 1-3 White Magic
Use:         This is a tough call.  The armor level is often not up to
	     par, and lots of investment is needed for good arrows, but
	     in the end, this is quite an effective class.  Make sure
	     you keep his arrow stock up!

  Taoist (Elementalist)
-------------
Weapon Type: Bells
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Terrain/Parry/Item
Strengths:   Element
Special:     Terrain:  Magic Attack based on fighting location.
Use:         Incredibly useless.  They look funny in their
	     North Pole outfit, but come up worthless in battle.

  Dragoon
-------------
Weapon Type: Spears
Armor Rank:  Strong
Commands:    Fight/Jump/Parry/Item
Strengths:   HP/Attack
Special:     Jump takes Dragoon out of battle for 1 round, thus suffering
	     no damage from enemies.  On second round, he will fall and
	     smash the opponent for up to 200% more damage.
Use:         Double up the spears and keep him flying.  If bosses use
	     some bad magic...jump may keep your fight alive.

  Viking
-------------
Weapon Type: Axe, Hammer
Armor Rank:  Medium
Commands:    Fight/Parry/Run/Item
Strengths:   HP/Attack
Special:     None
Use:         A good alternative to the fighter or knight for a short
	     time.  Axes hit less but are stronger.

   Caller
-------------
Weapon Type: Rods
Armor Rank:  Medium
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   Magic
Special:     Level 1-8 Call Magic (Effect type)
Use:         Its your choice.  Some of the later spells are better than
	     black magic, but there is not as much variety to the magic.

    Bard
-------------
Weapon Type: Harps
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Sing/Scare/Cheer/Item
Strengths:   none; not being able to just 'Fight' is annoying
Special:     Sing lets you sing the songs of troubadours. Cheer peps 
	     the party up. Scaring enemies is just silly. 
Use:         Well...if you feel adventurous....

  Summoner
-------------
Weapon Type: Rods
Armor Rank:  Weak
Commands:    Fight/Magic/Run/Item
Strengths:   Magic
Special:     Level 1-8 Call Magic (attack type)
Use:         This is basically the next level of Caller, with the only
	     additions being able to equip new armor and increase
	     magic effectiveness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2     What Magic is found or bought in FF3j?
___________________________________________________________________________

FF3j has 3 types of Magic:  Black (Attack), White (Healing), and 
Call (Attack by monster).  Certain Magic spells are not limited to
hitting one enemy or ally; if you press over far enough, all enemies
or allies will be selected.  This method spreads the single spell over
all enemies or allies, which gives a weaker effect.

Kill based magics are special: Their success rates depend on how
their level compares to yours, and upon a certain rate of chance.  At
even levels, 40% is my best percentage guess.

Elemental magics depend on your knowledge of the 4 elements.  In almost
all cases:      Lit beats Water
		Ice beats Fire
		Fire beats Ice
		Wind beats Earth

2.6     What are the various races in Final Fantasy?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Its not that complicated as some weird dungeons and dragons stuff.

-Humans are the most prolific beings.  If you, the gameplayer, are not
 one, I suggest looking at humans until you are familar with their
 shapes.  ;)

-Chocobos are the horses of Final Fantasy.  They are basically very
 large chickens that move much faster than humans. In FF3j, white chocobo's
 are not very intelligent, but Fat Chocobo's are.  They have a second
 stomach that stores your items without decay.

-Dwarves are a rather wild genetic turn.  Their faces are a complete
 shadow, with the exception of two white eyes that almost glow from their
 face.  Their bodies are actually just like humans, albeit a bit smaller,
 which confuses things more.  Every grown dwarf usually wears a horned
 helmet and triangular beard (Even females in some cases!).

-Elves are fairly generic.  They are usually a tad shorter than humans,
 with green clothing and a feathered cap a la Robin Hood.

-Faeries are exactly what you expect.  Tiny little ladies with
 butterfly wings that zoom about.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.65    Who are the Companions that travel with you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Person:         Info: 
Princess Sara   -The pretty (although sometimes childish) princess 
		 of Sasun Kingdom.  Accompanies you in the Cave of 
		 the Seal to defeat Jinn. 

Desh            -Went to the mountain looking for something. 
		 Accompanies you in your quest, after
		 you run from Bahamut.

Cid             -Master Airship creator. Helps you build two ships. 
		 Lives in Canaan but was stuck in Kazus when Jinn's 
		 curse was laid.

Elia            -The kind Maiden of Water. Accompanies you to the 
		 Water Crystal after you cure her. She is the only one 
		 who can open the sealed door in the Cave of Water to 
		 reach the Crystal.

Prince Alus     -Accompanies you to find out why his father the King 
		 Gorn of Salonia is acting so mysteriously.

Une             -The guardian of the World of Dreams. When you first 
		 come across Une, the bird Oumu will shoo you away. 
		 Accompanies you to find the great Invincible (an airship).

Dorga            -A great wizard. Accompanies you through the Mahoujin 
		  Cave and modification of the Nautilus to travel to 
		  the depths of the sea.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.67            How is Travel accomplished?                
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                
Mode:           Status:                
Walking         -Slowest.  Random number is generated each time
		 you enter the outworld, and when it reaches Zero,
		 you fight.  Each step you take has a value,
		 plain grass being -1, forests -3 (or so), etc.  
		 While the Enemy type is predetermined,  how you
		 fight it is not.  Reverse battles are caused by
		 overshooting the Zero by a certain number, and 
		 conversely, if you hit Zero exactly, you will
		 catch the enemy by surprise.  These values
		 also effect how many of a particular enemy
		 you face, but it is unclear to me how.

White Chocobo:  -Average Speed.   Chocobo's are found in forest areas,
		 often in trees formed into a small circle.  You
		 won't fight enemies while riding one, but when you
		 disembark, the Chocobo will automatically run back
		 to its home forest.  Chocobo's can walk through
		 rivers, plains, forests, and deserts.  
		 
Sailing Ship:   -Average Speed.  The ship is obtained by returning
		 the dragon eye to the Nepto Temple; The Vikings
		 will give it to you in gratitude.  The ship
		 can sail through ocean water only, but unlike
		 previous Final Fantasy I, you can disembark at any
		 shoreline.

Canoe:          -Slow.  The Canoe allows you to journey through
		 rivers and lakes, and is automatically carried during
		 your journey once you obtain it from the King of
		 Sasun.  Unfortunately, the waves of the ocean prove
		 too rough for it.

Cid's Airship
		-Average Speed. The Hikuutei is found in the desert   
		 west of Kazus. It can go over any surface
		 but mountains.  It can only land on grass plains, and
		 is eventually used as a wrecking ball (of sorts).
		 Enemies are not fought in Airships unless in special
		 areas.

Airship
Enterprise      -Above Average speed.  The enterprise is actually a 
		 modified version of the Sailing Ship, using a part
		 from the Floating Fortress.  This airship can go
		 over any surface except mountains, but can only
		 land in the ocean.  Enemies are not fought in 
		 Airships unless in special areas.

Airship
Nautilus        -Super Fast! The Nautilus is created by the Scholar's
		 guild in Salonia after they accidentally shoot down
		 the Enterprise.  Like the other airships, it can not
		 go over mountains, but instead can submerge under
		 the ocean water to find secret caves (once modified by
		 Dorga's magic spells).  The Nautilus
		 can only land on grass plains. Enemies are not fought 
		 in Airships unless in special areas.

Airship
Invincible      -Average Speed. The Invincible is the Battleship of
		of flight.  It is 4 times the size of the nautilus!
		 In case you have an Airship battle (in special areas),                 
		 the Invincible is armed with a cannon that hits all
		 enemies before each round begins. You can disembark
		 on any form of land (excluding mountains) because the
		 ship never actually lands!  Inside, the ship contains 
		 a free bed (Inn), 4 vending machines (Item, Weapon,
		 Armor, and Magic for sale), and a strange white bin.
		 Deposit a carrot, and the infamous Fat Chocobo will
		 appear, complete with his trademark music!  Also,
		 while driving the Invincible, if you press the
		 "A" button, the engines will temporarily increase
		 power to lift you over thin sections of mountains.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7     General FF strategy tips:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some tips that are common for almost every Final Fantasy game,
or at least for the duration of FF3j.

-Know your elements.  If you're in a water cave, use lightning. If you're
 in a fire cave, use ice. Likewise, if you're in an ice cave, use fire.
 If you're fighting the undead (zombies, etc.) use cure. If you're not
 sure, fire away with your highest level magic or look at the color
 and shape of the particular enemy you face.  Light Blue Urchins, 
 regardless of their current location, are suceptible to Lightning.

-Gain levels if you have a bit of trouble.  Level-ups are so crucial
 to surviving that I recommend trying not to run unless you are in
 extreme circumstances.  An extra couple of levels may make the 
 difference between life and death in a particular battle.

-Keep weaker party members in the back row.  Characters that do not
 have high level armor (magic users!) belong in the back row.  Back row
 characters only attack at 1/2 normal, but their defense is 1/2 better
 as well.  Since magic doesnt care about distance, keep them behind!

-Pair Like Weapons.  There is almost always a boost in attack power
 if you equip two of the exact same weapons on one character.

-Shields?  What are Shields?  Shields in FF3j are useless as far as
 I'm concerned.  For what usually amounts to a defense increase of 10,
 is better spent on a second weapon, which in most cases doubles or 
 triples attack power.

-Ok, maybe shields aren't THAT bad.  It just depends if you want
 defense or offense.  Its also possible to have dual shields, although
 to what advantage they could be is unknown.

-Greed is the key.  Final Fantasy is a game built for cleptomaniacs.
 If you see a treasure chest, open it.  Always search torches, bowls,
 fireplaces, even bookshelves, for goodies.  Consider it your danger-pay.

-Don't run around like a squirrel.  There is nothing wrong with running,
 but....during the round in which you try to run, your defense levels
 drop to zero.  However, if you are the size of a squirrel, feel free;
 your defense is already at zero anyway!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.75    What the hell is a Fat Chocobo?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fat Chocobo is another Final Fantasy trademark.  They are an 
extremely fat and multi-stomached Chocobo that is also quite
intelligent.  By using a certain veggie from the town of Gisahl (Carrot), 
which happens to be this chubby chocobo's favorite food, 
the Fat Chocobo will suddenly appear (boy is he hungry!) and will 
deposit any items you do not need immediatedly in his stomach.  
He most likely needs the items as something to digest his food with, 
but luckily, your items are unaffected even after long stays.  
However, he cannot swallow special items (or plot items).

The Chocobo appears in any forest by dropping a carrot where
'It smells like Chocobo's', or in the 'Invincible', where you can
also by vending machine carrots.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.8     How do I play the game?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's very easy, actually.  The control pad is for movement.  The A
button confirms actions, talks to people, searches things, and opens
treasure.  The B button CANCELs whatever you have selected.  Start
brings up your character screen.  Select changes who is the visible
party member.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.9     Im suffering a)from a lack of japanese understanding
		     b)from being stuck in a part of the game.
		     c)from not being able to make a decision on classes.
		     d)a feeling I've missed something.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can answer this question 4 different ways:
	     a)Learn Japanese.  It is available in most schools as
	       a language course.
	     b)Invite someone over who knows Japanese.
	     c)Read the Walkthrough.
	     d)Rough it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.15   Comparisons & Oddities
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-Not only do the moogles and chocobo's appear, but FF1 trademark
	 princess Sara does as well.  Combine that with the Gurgan
	 tribe who behave suspiciously like the circle of mages in
	 FF1, and you have the hint of something like a true sequel
	 in the FF series.

	-The Hyn Fortress is made of the oldest tree in the world;
	 the mana tree.  Combine that with the moogles appearing...
	 prelude to Secret of Mana?

	-Some people refer to the carrot as Gisairu Vegetable, others
	 as Gisahl...odd enough.  I'm still waiting for multi opinions
	 on some of the translations.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1     What's with some of the weird names?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	In most cases, the word is simply the english pronounciation
	to some point. (Example: Mahoujin Cave)

	In all other cases:
		a)Name from the Partial Translation
		b)Name from Tushino's FF3j World 1 Walkthrough
		c)Name I have come up with from an educated guess.      
		d)Name is FF tradition. 
		 (Gisahl Vegetable is the Carrot.  Since FF4, etc, )
		 (does not have the town of Gisahl, the traditional)
		 (name of Carrot works better and is easily )
		 (understood. Since FFIIIj was not translated to the US,)
		 (the name would not make sense to Americans playing)
		 (FFII US.)

	Tushino:        Tushino@mail.telis.org
		-He created a couple of fantastic files which serve

		 his guide to help me, I would never have wanted
		 to write a FAQ to especially cover the 2nd half
		 of the game.

	Lamuness:       andych@yesic.com        
		-Went over the FAQ and added some hints and

	Kesac:          -------
		-Did a few little 'modifications' to give me the 
		 complete list of weapons, armor, and items
		 in the game.

	Krusader        mattfitz@ea.oac.uci.edu
		-Filled me in on some technical points to the game,
		 as well as a whole slew of translation fixes.  The 
		 game is starting to sound more english!  :)

	SoM2Freak       --------
		- Drives me nuts by making me reformat everything and
		  using a .doc Word 7 format (dumb), but he is 
		  responsible for much of the translated sections and 
		  other tidbits!  ^_^

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.0     Walkthrough
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORMAT:         #. Place: 
		Location:  Whereabouts
		Shops:     Type of Shops available
		Boss:      Super-monster of level
		Enemies:   Monsters wandering
		Treasure:  Items found in treasure chests
		Recommendations:  1: My personal selections
				  2: Tushino's personal Selections
				  3: Lamuness' personal Selections


1. Altar Cave:  

Location: North of Ul Town
Treasure: various; pick up the Antarctic Winds (Ice Blasts I think)
Boss:     Land Turtle 
Starting group: Onionkid/Onionkid/Onionkid/Onionkid

	Search for treasure, and fight enemies while keeping in mind 
that there is a healing lake in the the upper right corner of the first 
floor. It would be a good idea to save the antartic's you pick up for 
later in the game. Gain levels up to Level 5 before you enter the door 
at the upper left.

Upon entering the Crystal Room, the only enemy is the giant turtle 
guarding the Wind Crystal. Fight him with regular attacks, and use a 
Potion to heal if absolutely necessary.  Once you beat it, talk to the 
Crystal.  You will gain the ability to change characters into 1 of 5 
classes.

A) New Classes: Fighter, Monk, Red Mage, White Mage, Black Mage

Recommendations:

	1:       Fighter/Monk/White Mage/Black Mage
	2:       Fighter/Monk/Red Mage  /Black Mage    
	3:       Fighter/Monk/Black Mage/ White Mage

If you are really greedy, enter the cave again after leaving to get 
more treasure.  There are a few spots in the cave that obviously look like
dead ends, but are actually fake walls filled with treasures.

2. Ul Town: 
Location: South of the Altar Cave; home of the characters
Shops:    Weapon/Armor/Item/Magic/Revival
Treasure: Check out the well, and the storehouse in the back of the town!
Enemies:  Same as Overworld Around Ul

	Upon entering Ul, press start and switch to the jobs menu.  There 
will be 6 classes listed: Onionkid, Fighter, Black Mage, Red Mage, 
White Mage, and Monk.  Its up to you who you want to change, although 
if you're really asking for it, you dont have to change anybody.  

HINT #1:  You must un-equip your character before they can change
	  classes.

HINT #2:  Remember to place mages in the back row using the 'rank' 
	  command.  By moving to the back row, they sacrifice 50%
	  of their weapon strength, but gain double in terms of
	  defense.

	As for Ul, head immediatedly to the shops and stock up.  
Fighters work best with 2 swords, Monks with no weapons, Red mages 
with sword and shield, White mages with 2 staffs, and Black mages with 
2 daggers.     

	Want some free stuff?  As in every town in the game, always check 
ceramic pots and torches.  Quite often you will activate a secret door 
or find something.  In this case, some of the trees are not what they 
seem.  You can also enter a well for some goodies.

	Nothing changes much in this town; but be careful when walking 
around the north end; you will fight enemies.  This is a good place for 
experience though.
	
	Talk to the elder, Topapa. He will send the kids, who have been 
chosen by the Crystals to be the Light Warriors, out on a journey to save 
the world from the overflow of darkness! 

	     
3. Kazus Town: 
Location: South of Ul Town
Shops:    None Active (curse of Jinn) 
Treasure:
Enemies:  (Mithril Mines) Skeletons, Mummies

	As shown by the scared traveler huddled at his fire, the town is 
full of ghosts because of the curse placed by Jinn. Although the cave is 
empty and useless, there are still items to be found.  If you want to get
down to business, talk to the ghost that does not move in the bar. This 
is actually Cid, the master engineer, in disguise. He will tell you where 
his secret airship is hidden: The desert to the west.

4. Desert area: Cid's Airship
Location: West of Kazus
Enemies:

	Walk into the middle of the small desert patch.  You will 
automatically climb down a ladder into the control center of the 
Hikuutei (Airship). This airship has average speed, but cannot go 
over mountains, and has to land on grass.

5. Sasun Castle
Location: Northwest of The Desert
Shops: 
Treasure: Look around. Walls are not always solid in FF3j! 
Enemies:  DarkEyes and stuff. Watch out, the Griffon that guards 
	  the WhiteSlayer is pretty tough.

	This a treasure hunt of easter egg proportions.  The castle
is devoid of friendly life, but the two towers contain enemies.  One of 
the treasures in the two towers contains an enemy far stronger than the 
rest (a Griffon).  Clean his clock with items and magic you find elsewhere 
in the castle to obtain the 'White Slayer'; a sword for Red Mages.

6. Cave of the Seal: 
Location: North of the Big Boulder
Treasure: Get the 'Cure' spell in the treasure chest here! It's 
	  useful against the undead monsters- and the heavy damage 
	  they inflict on your party.
Enemies:  Undeads galore.
Boss:     Jinn  

	Use the airship to cross the water and enter the cave.  Search for 
treasure, but keep a lookout for Princess Sara.  Join up with her and 
continue on to battle the evil Jinn. Use an Antarctic Wind on Jinn. 
That'll blow him away! He's pretty much a pushover if you're ready for him.  
Remember where you parked your airship! 

	After the battle, Sara will seal the weakened Jinn in her Mithril 
Ring. Sara will use the Ring's power to warp her and the party to the holy 
spring in Sasun Castle. She'll then toss the Ring, with Jinn sealed within, 
into the shining water. Now the curse is lifted! But ironically, it is a 
sad time for the party must now part with the Princess Sara. She tells 
them she will wait always for their return, and they must be sure to 
come back when their journey is over.


7. Sasun Castle (Revived): 
Location: Northwest of Desert
Shops:    Revival/Healing       
Treasure: None.  You should have cleaned this place out by now.

	Talk to the king of Sasun to receive the canoe.  The canoe will 
let you cross the water to retrieve your airship. Also, if you still 
have a Red Mage, Tushino recommends changing it to either a black or 
white mage.

8. Kazus (Revived): 
Location: South of Ul Town
Shops:    Weapon/Armor/Item/Magic/Revival
Treasure: None.  You should have cleaned this place out by now.

	Once you enter Kazus, Cid will talk to you about rigging your 
airship.  He plans to turn it into a bomb to knock out the big boulder 
which is blocking the path to the Nelb Valley, which leads to the town 
of Canaan, where Cid lives.  Stay in town long enough to grab some items, 
weapons, magic, and armor.
		
Note: Doesn't the mine seem awfully suspicious? Well, you're right for 
thinking that.  With Cid tagging along, switch the visible character to 
the FIGHTER, and have him search the dead end.  You should find 2 Mithril 
Swords.


9. The Big Boulder: 
Location: South of Cave of Seal

	For most established Final Fantasy players, watching the Hikuutei 
burst into flames and rubble will bring a tear to your eye, considering 
how long it usually takes to get an airship.  Just walk past where the big
rock once stood and head south.

10. Canaan: 
Location: South of the Big Boulder
Shops: Normal stuff    
Treasure: Try going down the waterfall to find an Elixir!

	This place kind of sucks.  Drop Cid off and head to the magic shop, 
because magic is all you need.  The armor and weapons are rehashes from 
Kazus.  Make sure to loot the city.   This is where Cid lives; you 
might need to call him later on.

	Note: There is a very tricky way to get some nice items from Cid, 
but it will cost you the Elixir you find in town.  Use the Elixir to cure 
Sarina when the time comes instead of something cheap.  Cid will then let 
you press a switch that opens their basement.  Search around for a bow, 
magic, and other neat stuff.
		

11. Bahamut's nest
Location: East of Canaan
Treasure: Aero (White Magic),                                        
Enemies:  Lots of bird enemies.
Boss:     Bahamut
	
	If there was ever a time to gain levels, that time is now.  The 
enemies on the mountain are tough, and if you want to get all the treasure 
(yes) then you will fight a lot of them.  When you reach the nest of 
Bahamut, head over to the weird spot in the upper left corner.  This thing 
is actually Desh, who will join your group. He found a type of magic, 
Size, and gives it to the party. This will be very important!!

	Shortly after, Bahamut will appear. Its possible that you could 
beat the master of dragons, but he has around 65000 HP that is automatically 
restored at the end of each round.  I suggest running..and fast! After 
running from Bahamut, Desh and the party will jump off the top of the 
mountain!!

12. Forest of Recovery
Location: Forest north from Bahamut Drop Zone.
Shops:    Revival/Healing
Treasure: None
	
There is only one midget in the forest. Heal at the springs and head south. 
You need to cast the spell of Size that Desh gave to you to continue past 
this point.  Press over so the finger points to everyone in the party 
so you only have to cast Size once!  

	Note: When in midget form, your attack and defense is shot all the 
way down to the ugly number one.  Make sure everybody is in the back row, 
and dont fight with anybody unless you feel cocky and full of magic.

13. The Town of Midgets: Tozas
Location: South of the Forest of Recovery
Shops:    Weapon/Armor/Item/Magic/Revival
Treasure: Buy some Midget Pans! And remember to loot Shelko's shelves!!

This is one small town!  To enter it, you must first cast Size on the 
party (like I told you before) and then step on the square of forest where 
the village is located. Loot the village, then head to the upper left 
house. Shelko is sick, and cannot leave her house to find a cure.  Walk up
to her bed, press the "B" button, and give her a herb.  Her sickness will 
quickly dissapear, and in thanking, she will open an emergency escape 
entrance.  Have no mercy, for Shelko has the richest book shelves in 
town. Go through the exit road!

14. The Road out of Tozas:
Location: Escape area from Shelko's Home
Treasure: None
Enemies: DarkFaces, Leprechauns

This can be tough.  You have to be in midget form to make it through the 
level, so keep everybody back and try to run like hell!  If necessary, 
use black magic to hold off persistant foes.

15. The Viking Base
Location: North of the exit of the road leaving Tozas
Shops:    Inn/Item/Magic/Revival
Treasure: Fire2, Ice2, Lit2,

This place is chock full of treasure.  Look -everywhere-.  There are 
suspicious bricks with darkened edges and wall irregularities that can 
be walked through.  There is even decoy secrets to keep you from getting 
to the treasure.  If you are frustrated, fire the cannon.  It doesn't do 
anything but waste time, but it makes a neat splash!

When you exit the cave, you will notice a sailing ship.  You can board it, 
but the gulf is protected by an immortal sea creature, the powerful Nepto 
Dragon! Nepto has been frightening the Vikings lately, and won't let them 
through. He won't let you through, either! Don't try it. He'll just kill 
you.  He is angry because something stole his right eye from the Shrine of 
Nepto!

16. Nepto Shrine
Location: Northwest of Viking Hideout Exit
Treasure:
Enemies:
Boss:     Big Rat

	Another annoying midget level.  You have to return the dragon's 
right eye by switching to midget form and and walking up to the dragon 
head.  If you try to return to full size your mission will abruptly end.  
Load up your black mage if you intend to survive.  Also make sure to pick 
up all the treasure; there is no return visit.  As for the Rat, pelt him 
with Ice2 and antarctics.

17. Returning to the Viking Hideout
Location: South of Nepto Shrine
Shops:    See 14.
Treasure: None.  You should have cleaned this place out by now!

Talk to the boss of the ship inside the viking hideout, and he will grant 
it to you. Now you are able to sail out to sea. Ahoy! The Nepto Dragon is 
no longer angry, so you are free to pass!

18. Tokkle Village
Location: Southwest of the Shrine (Near Big Desert)
Treasure:

Just try to find treasure; some is hidden in the high grass.  Tokkle was 
destroyed by the villanous soldiers of Hyn's Castle, and after talking to 
the jumpy old men, you will discover that the soldiers took prisoners as 
well.  Unfortunately, Hyn Castle is a floating (and thus unreachable) 
fortress.

19. Village of the Ancients
Location: Far West of the Big Desert near Tokkle village
Shops:    Inn/Item/Revival/Weapons/Armor/Magic
Treasure:

This is a good village to stock up on items from. Get everybody up to 
speed armor/weapon/magic-wise, and try to gain a few levels before 
heading up to the Living Forest.

20. Living Forest
Location: Small Forest North of Big Desert (Surrounded by Mountains)

The fairies will reveal some information about the guru tribe and the evil 
medusa, and give you a hint about beating the Wizard Hyn's Barrier Change 
technique. They also tell about the mana tree, the oldest in the world, 
that has been cursed by Hyn and made into his floating fortress.

21. Gurgan Tribe's Canyon
Location: Northwest of the Living Forest
Treasure: Toad

The ancient Gurgans are born without sight, but with a sixth sense that 
allows them to see the events of the future...  Head down to the basement, 
where the last guru will give you the magic of Toad.  It will come in 
handy for penetrating the Tower of Owen where Medusa hides.

22. Argas Castle
Location: Northeast of Living Forest
Shops:    Revival/Healing
Treasure:

Much like Sasun castle once was, Argas is completely empty and -ripe for 
the picking!-.  Check walls, torches, and more to find important treasure 
and extra cash. As for the two green doors; you have to buy magic keys 
from the keysmith in Gisahl before you can open them.  The value of the 
treasure is far beyond the cost of the keys, however.

23. Tower of Owen
Location: Far North of Tokkle
Treasure: Much, including the Tilving and some other neat stuff
Enemies:  Fairly hard!! Watch out!
Boss:     Medusa

This infamous tower of medusa is a maze of clock-work and amphibians.  In 
the center of the first wet floor is a strange drain hole.  Use Toad magic 
to become frogs, and dive down.  Once you have surfaced, feel free to 
switch back; its a long hike.  Eventually, you will reach a dead end.  
However, Desh points out that one of the gears along the top wall is 
actually a  switch.  Hit the secret switch 8 steps to the right of 
the left wall and continue your hard hike to the top of the tower.  

	For the fight with Medusa, your most powerful magic and weapon 
attacks should do the trick.  She will just continuously cast Break, but 
you should  be able to finish her off before your party is turned into 
nice works of art.  After Medusa is defeated, ....well, that's an important 
part of the storyline. You don't get to know!! ;)

	Anyways, the whirl in the sea that was blocking the ship's 
passage will be disappated when the flame that powers the Tower of Owen is
...extinguished. (no you don't get to know how!)

24. Gisahl Town
Location: Far East Side of the World (East of Tozas)
Shops:    Inn/Item/Magic/Revival/Keys
Treasure:

The isolated farming community of Gisahl proves to be useful.  There are 
essential magics, scared animals, penned chocobos; even gardens of the 
trademark Gisahl Vegetables to step on!  Make sure to purchase a dozen 
or so keys, and head back to Argas to finish looting.

25. Dwarf Cave
Location: Northwest area of the world (Northwest of Tower of Owen)
Shops:    Inn/Item/Armor/Weapons/Revival
Treasure:
Enemies:
Boss:     The thief, Guzco (weak)

According to the elves, the villanous Guzco stole one of their precious 
magical horns. Load up and head to the left entrance; by switching to 
toad form at the head of the pool, you will enter the cave to Guzco.
You are once again free to switch back and improve your survival rate 
by a large scale.

Unfortunately, the treasures are pretty much worthless; unless you feel 
like getting level ups, avoid them. The boss is the under-estimating 
Guzco; use ice magics and weapons to defeat him.

To make things worse, Guzco doesn't know when to quit, so he follows you 
as a 2 dimensional line until you exit the cave.  Go to the display and 
place the horn using the B button; Guzco will reappear and steal BOTH
horns.  He then retreats to the Cave of Fire. In his home territory, he 
powers up to become the dreadful 'Salamander'.


26. Cave of Fire
Location: North of the Dwarf Cave
Treasure: Ice Sword,
Enemies:
Boss:     Salamander (strong)

	Salamander lets you know that the horns he stole are the Horns 
of Ice! They have the power to blow away the flames that have previously 
been blocking the entrance to the Cave of Fire. He plans to make the 
amazingly great powers of the Fire Crystal his own!

The fire cave is a real tough place. Level up for awhile; anything under 
lv.13 is not a good idea.  Be sure to pick up all the treasure; the ice 
sword in particular is useful for Salamander.

When you finally reach the evil Salamander, start hacking away with 
whatever ice weapons/magic that are at your disposal.  To counteract 
Salamander's 'Group-Fire', have your white mage cast cure 2 on the entire 
group using the same technique as when casting size or toad.

After defeating Salamander, events start to 'heat' up (pun intended).  
The Crystal will bestow 4 new possible classes unto your Light 
Warriors: Knight, Thief, Archer, Scholar.

New Classes:            Knight, Thief, Archer, Scholar

	Recommendations:

	1:       Knight, Monk, Wh. Mage, Bl. Mage
	2:       Knight, Archer, Wh. Mage, Bl.Mage
	3:       Knight, Monk, Bl. Mage, Wh. Mage

27. Dwarf Cave (Again)
Location: Northwest area of the world (Northwest of Tower of Owen)
Shops:
Treasure: *Voice/*Elixir/Hero Shield/Gauntlet/Gneedle/
	  Scholar Helm/Scholar Armor/Knight Armor/Carrot/
	  Fenix Down/

	Upon entering the cave, an exhausted man will run behind you to 
ask for your help.  Tokkle has been attacked again!  He then dies shortly 
after.  Ignore this grim moment and head into the main section of the 
cave.  Talk to the stationary dwarf in the bottom right corner, and in
gratitude for the returned horns, the dwarf will remove the boulder near 
the revival water. Head down there and discover: The dwarf TREASURY! 
Pick it clean!

28. Tokkle Village (Revisited - Get Ambushed) 
Location: Southwest of the Nepto Temple 
Treasure: None. You should have already cleaned this place out!
Enemies: Soldiers of Hyn Castle.

As soon as you enter the town, a group of soldiers jumps from the foliage 
and ambushes you.  They take you to Hyn Castle, controlled by the Death 
Mage himself, Hyn! He orbits the in the Desert Castle of Hyn, made
from the Mana Tree.

29. Hyn Castle
Location: Floating Fortress in the Desert
Treasures:
Enemies:  Lamia, Mummy,
Boss:     The wizard Hyn

	You wake up in a crowded jail cell.  The three men in the upper 
right corner are King Argas and his aids; the others were captured from
Tokkle.  The man to the exact left (stationary) is an undercover guard 
and will fight you if you talk to him.

Talk to all of the 'friendly' prisoners, then look at the north wall for 
a small mousehole.  Use Size magic to enter the hole into the enemy infested 
territory.  Switch back to full size and get ALL of the treasure; if you 
have your way, the fortress won't be floating for long.

	One point of advice; the Lamia and Mummies are very annoying 
adversaries.  Use fire magic to deal with them quickly, but if party 
members become confused, get your white or black mage to smack 'em.  
Damage will be minimal and you will regain a party member.  
		
Hyn is a buncha bones with a flair for the dramatic, according to his 
costume.  He apparently has the ability to 'Barrier Change', but in 
my experience, you can forget about his abilities by hitting him
hard the first 2 rounds with Ice 3 and weapons. If not, make sure you 
have a Scholar in your party to Peer into his defenses (this is really 
the one place where a Scholar's abilities can shine). Swords
arent very effective; but you want to deal with him and his 1600 HP 
ASAP.   


30. The Living Forest (Revived)
Location: Southwest of Castle Argas

Once you deal with Hyn, you will automatically return here.  The faeries 
will thank you for returning the mana tree and destroying Hyn, as well
as a few things I cant interpret.  After this, you cannot enter the 
forest again. Your airship is waiting at Tokkle.

31. Argas Castle (Revisited) 
Location: South of the Tower of Owen
Shops:    Revival/Healing
Treasure: Elixirs

Walk to the top floor and speak to King Argas and his aids.  The king 
will give you a tool he stole from the Hyn Castle that he believed was 
used in  keeping it afloat.  Of course, you know absolutely nothing about 
airships...but Cid does. Now take the tool, known as the Gear of Time, 
to Cid!

NOTE:  If you have a white mage at this point, switch him to the front 
       and open the locked doors.  In one of the doors is a magician:  
       Talk to him to get elixirs.


32. Canaan (Revisited)
Location: West of Bahamut Mountain.
Shops:
Treasure: None.  You should have got it all from this place by now!

Walk to Cid's house (upper left corner) and give him the Gear of Time 
you recieved from King Argas.  Cid is a good airship mechanic 
(despite his nose seemingly blocking his eyesight), and will upgrade 
your sailing ship to an airship: The 'Enterprise!'  

When you walk out of town, nothing looks different.  The ship looks the 
same.  Climb in and press the 'A' button however, and your ship will 
sprout helicopter rotors!  Unfortunately, the enterprise can only
land in water, and cannot go over mountains. 

33. Fly off!
Location: On the Enterprise
Treasure: None
Enemies:  None
	
	Take your new/cool Airship to travel off this floating continent 
you have been on into an even bigger world. You can tell if you've flown 
out if you see any clouds nearby. Just fly out to the clouds 
and you will exit your small world and go to the huge new world
of endless seas.

34. Tozas (Revisited)
Location: South of Forest of Recovery
Treasure: None
		
	Head back and buy as many Midge Pans as possible.  These are your 
map for the second world...unless you like zooming over water for 
hours.  Your choice.

35. Solitary Island 
Location: Northwest of Floating Continent
Treasure: None
Enemies:  None
		
	Walk unto the wrecked ship.  A lady is injured and an old man can 
do nothing.  Use herbs to heal the woman, Elia. You will be told of the 
situation in this world and what has happened to Elia since the Great 
Earthquake occurred. Most of the earth sank into the sea and all that is 
left is the highest point of land. The old man was riding on his boat 
when the earthquake came, and thus was saved. He found Elia clinging to 
a piece of driftwood.  (Hey, I didn't know Waterworld copied Final 
Fantasy IIIj!! hehe).  She wants you to take her to the Temple of Water 
so that she can get the shard of the Water Crystal that is there and give 
its remaining energy back to the Crystal to try to reawaken the 
Crystal's powers. 

36. Water Temple 
Location: Southwest of Floating Continent
Treasure: None
Enemies:  None
		
	Pick up the Crystal Shard. The two pools of water are healing 
and revival ponds, respectively.

37. Cave of Water
Location: Northeast of Water Temple
Treasure:
Enemies: lots!!

	When you reach the sealed door (very early in the cave), Elia 
will kneel and pray something to open door. Proceed to find the 
Water Crystal. Elia gives the light (power of hope) left in the
Crystal Shard back to the Crystal of Water. It works! Unfortunately,
Kraken crashes the party, and kills Elia.  Make sure you
do the same to Kraken. He has 1950 HP.
	
	Now, another earthquake begins! The cave begins to collapse, and 
the party gets in a tussle.  'How can you leave Elia!!' complains one of 
the party members. But, Kraken's Cursed Arrow has already taken her life.  
The party is knocked unconscious as the power of water ressurrects the  
second world from the depths of the sea! 

New Classes:    Karate Master, Viking, Paladin, Taoist, Caller, Bard, 
		Dragoon

		Recommendations:

	1:        Knight, Karate Master, Wh. Mage, Bl. Mage
	2:       *Knight, Karate Master, Bl. Mage, Wh. Mage
		  (Uses Dragoon for Salonia temporarily)

38. The Town of Water, Amur & Sewers
Location: Southwest of Water Temple
Treasure:
Enemies:
	
	You wake up the Amur Inn. Some people found you unconscious in 
the Temple of Water after the earth reappeared from the sea! And you hear 
the terrible news that your airship has been chained up by Goldor who 
lives to the southeast of Amur across the Bottomless Swamp. Trying to 
cross the Bottomless Swamp without some special footwear is suicidal! 
Meet the 4 old men.


The problem of the weird old men can be solved however.  For some reason, 
their magic shoes have been taken.  Talk to the man whose house you meet 
them at, then stock up for a sewer journey, via the little waterfall in the 
bottom right quarter.  Venture through, save the quadruplets from a bunch 
of Goblins (Imps) (One shot of fire1 will take care of them all at once).  
Eventually, you will see a strange old hag, named Delila. You will jump 
out of the way of several explosive (?) shoe tosses before the quadruplets 
come and grab a pair.

	Inexplicably, the quadruplets are ecstatic and you 
automatically leave the sewer.  Talk to them again to borrow the shoes,
and leave to Goldor's Mansion.

39. Goldor's Mansion

Location: Southeast of Amur
Treasure:
Enemies:
		
NOTE:  Without the shoes on loan from the 4 Old Men,
       (automatically used...) you can't cross the swamp
       without dying.

HINT:   Notice how the merchants in Amur had a lot
	of thief related weapons?  Well, if you dont have
	keys, you will notice the conspiracy in action.
	Put a thief in the group unless you have some keys!

	This is the SECOND place where those magic keys come in
handy.  Go straight up, ignoring the doors, and go all the way around to 
pick up the treasure.  Among other things, you get 11 weak swords that 
are worth a pretty penny....because they are gold plated!

Head back down and take the upper right door.  Use a magic key to enter.  
If you look closely, a brick on the bottom left wall is different: 
Walk through it.  

Along the way are many secrets; including one precarious area where the 
path that loops down looks completely unneccessary...until you check the 
walls!

The Boss of this level protects another Crystal.  Be careful, this boss 
is TOUGH.  He is strong against Ice and Lit, and Fire is completely 
ineffective.  Air works a few times, fortunately for moderate damage. 
Attacks hit at about 50%...and not for much.  Every round, have one person 
use healing magic or HiPotions.  Goldor will either attack 
(under 100 damage), use element magic (300-400 damage) or 
Ice3 (800 damage).  He has 2250 HP.

	If you play it right, you can make it through some of them, for 
the other, you must consider whether wasting a fenix down is worth it.  
EVENTUALLY, he will be beaten; but in a moment of rage, he and the crystal
will dissapear.  All that is left is a key.  Take it and use exit 
(or just walk) out. There is a chocobo forest right outside for your 
convenience.

What does the key do?  It unlocks the chains to the Enterprise!  Luckily, 
the airship portion is also fully intact.


40. Dastar

Location: Southeast of Salonia
Treasure:
Enemies:  None
		
	This place is basically dedicated to the Bard and 
Taoist Class.  The Bards there continually try to emulate a sacred 
tune, but all is for not, as only the mystical Lute can produce the 
sacred tune of awakening.

41. Leprit

Location: Northwest of Salonia
Treasure:
Enemies:  None
		
	Caller orientated.  If you have one, this is the best place to 
visit to get up to date on magic, weapons, and armor.


42. The Kingdom of Salonia

Location: Large walled-in Castle and Town.
Treasure:
Enemies:

	Fly the enterprise over the Kingdom of Salonia (its a very
large enclosed town area with a castle smack in the center).  If you 
fly around the castle, cannonballs will start firing!  Unfortunately, 
they fire enough to gun you down.  Say goodbye to the trusty Enterprise,
because like many a Star Trek Film,  "She just canno' go any farther captain."

Luckily (?!?!?!?) you will land in between the two armies that shot you down.  
Apparently each group thought you belonged to the other.  Ignore them 
(and the weird music) for now, and visit the 4 sections of the city.

Section 1 (SW) highlights:  

		This place has not much of use except
	for the appearance of another classic FF item: 
	The Fat Chocobo!  Talk to the student to make 
	him appear.  Fat Chocobo swallows your items 
	(stores them) so you can free up item spaces.  
	Just visit him again later to retrieve.

Section 2 (NW) highlights:  

		One weapon shop (obscure), an inn, and 
	some more locked shops.  The Magic Key doesnt work 
	here.  However, this place is a required visit.

	If you talk to the the Sages, one will point you 
	to the Punk Bar.  Enter, and you will find 4 punks 
	trying to beat up a well dressed kid. Automatically
	you will give them their just desserts!

	They are just 4 simple mini golden warriors and 
	are easily defeated.  The boy is actually Prince 
	Alus of Salonia.  He will join your party and give 
	you the authority necessary to enter the castle.     
			
Section 3 (NE) highlights:  

		Another Inn.  The bookshop and magic
		shops are locked.

Section 4 (SE) highlights:  
	
		The only open building is a tower in
	the middle of town. It is chock full of enemies.  
	Walk through the winding secret passageways of 
	the first floor, and climb the tower to take in 
	some goodies, including sets of dragon armor!

43. Castle Salonia

Location: Middle of Salonia
Treasure:
Enemies:  None

	Enter the castle and you will be automatically escorted to the 
prince's chambers.  You will wake up once and talk with the prince, but 
the second time, the King rushes in with a knife drawn!! He attacks Alus! 
Then, when the King stalls in his murder of the Prince, the Retainer, 
Gigameth, enters! It turns out he has been controlling the King for quite 
some time.  That is what was making the King act so strangely! The poor 
King, who has been under another's control for so long, would rather die 
by his own hand than take the life of his beloved son. So, the King stabs 
himself with the knife. Gigameth becomes EXTREMELY angry and screams a few 
not-very-nice (;)) things at the party, and transforms into the great 
Garuda! Get ready for one of the hardest fights of your life!!

Garuda is no slouch.  Every round he uses 'Kaminari' (Thunder), a lightning 
attack that hits EVERYONE for 300-400 hp damage each round.  On the good 
side, he is weak to Wind.  If you have a Dragoon (which explains all the 
dragoon treasure from the 4 towers), his wind spear and jump command 
will prove to be helpful.

My advice?  Have a White Mage cast Cure2 EVERY round, including the first 
one.  Have at least 2 heavy fighters (in my case a fighter + Monk.. yours 
may differ) and have them fire away every round.  Your fourth party member 
in most cases is a useless black mage.  Ice3 is almost always paltry...so 
get him curing your fighters with hipotions every round.  Eventually,
cure2 will run out, so have the 4th member use an elixir on your white 
mage.  If youre lucky, you will only lose 1 character at that point.  
At level 26,I managed to come out of the battle alive (5th try)
with only my Monk and White Mage.  The phoenix, Garuda, has 5000 HP.

After Garuda dies, the King dies as well.  You and the Prince have a moment 
of silence before Alus resolves that he will be strong and follow in his 
father's footsteps as King of Salonia! 

Before you leave the castle, talk around.  The Scholars, especially, are 
handy.  They are so sorry about the Enterprise, that they build you 
something better: The Nautilus!!!!  The Nautilus operates like your
first airship in that it only lands in grass and cant cross mountains...
but its about 3x faster than anything else.

No, you're not done yet!  Head back to towns 1-4 for open shops full of 
goodies like White/Black mage armor and the next level of spells. 
(cure 3 anyone?)
	



44. Une's Shrine
Location: Salonia Continent.

		Visit the Guardian of the World of Dreams, Une's, 
cave and talk to the bird, Oumu. Une is in a deep slumber. Nothing 
will happen...yet. =) 


45. Dorga's House

Location: Southern Continent
Treasure:
Enemies:

	You enter the weird shrine when suddenly...several large armed 
furry creatures gang up on you.  Luckily, their leader, a dark cloaked 
man, waves them off.  Those furry creatures are actually MOOGLES!  
Contrary to popular belief, FF3j is the first appearance of those
loveable winged teddies!

The leader, Dorga, joins your group, and now the moogles are your best 
of friends.  Head down to their magic shop and fill up on goodies!


46. Mahoujin Cave

Location: Hidden in Dorga's House
Treasure:
Enemies:

	Oh boy...another midget cave!  This one is located in Dorga's; 
touch the torch.  If you can make it through this tough place, you will 
eventually reach a place where Dorga explains that he can transform the 
Nautilus into a submarine ship that can take you to the undersea. He 
chants an ancient spell on the Nautilus and disappears.  Luckily, you then 
are warped back to the entrance of his home. The Nautilus is now both an 
airship and a submarine!

47. Salonia Basement

Location: South of East Salonia
Treasure:
Enemies:
		This one is located south in the water below town 4.
Make sure you have at least 10 magic keys.  There is loads of important 
treasure to pick up, ending in a battle with Odin!

Odin is one difficult boss!  He uses a powerful multi slice attack.  Use 
Cure3 on the party each round, and make sure to nail him with Fire3...he 
is very weak to it.  If you win, you gain his call magic spell.

48.  The Temple of Time

Location:  Circular Bay at bottom of Salonia Continent
Treasures: Noah's Lute         LamiaScale         Protect Ring x2 etc.

This one is located in the bay at the south of the continent with Une's 
Shrine.  Once again, load up on keys.  There are fairly strong enemies,
but no bosses.  Lots of treasure including a musical instrument that 
supposedly wakes up the unwakeable.  They call it...Noah's Lute!

49.  Dorga's Village

Location: Southeast of Dorga's House
Treasure: None
Enemies:  None

	On the continent with Dorga's House is a small completely enclosed 
town.  While the airship can't go above the mountains, if you submerse 
near the town, you will notice some discolored mountains that
you can go through.  Resurface at the end of the path!

Except for the greeting mage, who explains the town, every black mage is 
a magic merchant.  You can buy anything from Level 2 to Level 7 magic!  
Stock up if you have the cash!

50.  Undersea Cave:

Location: Near Goldor's Mansion
Treasure:       Tomahawk Axe            Ancient Sword
		Defender Sword          Diamond Shield x2
		Diamond Armor           Loki's Harp
		Fenix Down              Diamond Glove
		Elixir                  Aegis Shield    -> Fight Bone Dragon
		Diamond Helmet          Triton Hammer   -> Fight Mouth Man
		BlackHole               Reflect Armor   -> Fight 8 Claw
		Bacchus' Wine           Blood Spear     -> Fight Red Dragon
		Diamond Helmet
		BlackHole
		Bacchus' Wine

		This one is located under the water by the island 
devoid of life east of the the golden house.

	THIS PLACE ROCKS!  If you ever wanted a place to loot, this place 
is it!  I had to visit the Fat Chocobo TWICE just to get everything.  What 
you don't want is still worth thousands of dollars! Be greedy!  Be VERY
greedy!


51. Une's Shrine. (Revisited)

Location: Near Salonia
Treasure: None
Enemies:  None

		Head back here with the Lute.  Activate it in front
of Une's bed...and she wakes up and goes nuts, jumping about!  Then 
she mumbles something about a mystical ship, grabs her parrot, and 
joins your party.  Her name is Une, Guardian of the World of Dreams.

52. Ancient Ruins Excavation

Location: Near the cave where Une slept
Treasure:
Enemies:
		Be prepared, for this is one of the hardest 
levels in the Final Fantasy Series.  Walk up to the rocks blocking the 
way and Une will use her skills to remove them.

The next floor is simple; the Scholars (real airship nuts who are part 
of the group that built the Nautilus) have opened 3 shops to help you.  
However; if you have taken the treasures from the other caves, only
the Inn is useful.

		Now begins the trek.  3 rules of thumb:

	1.The Blue Spore Enemies will almost always reproduce
	  by themselves.  Hit them hard and fast!

	2.The Green Spore Enemies only reproduce if you hit them
	  with a weapon, and the damage does not kill them.  
	  Be careful; both spores can hit anywhere from 1-1500 damage.

	3.Anything Green basically follows the Green Spore rule.

		It can get extremely frustrating as they duplicate;
		but if you make sure your strong weapon men can kill
		in one hit, and you only use elemental magic on
		one enemy at a time, you can make it.  Whats so good
		to go through all this hell?


	The airship: Invincible

	While it is slow compared to the speedy Nautilus, it makes up for 
it in many ways.  The Invincible has Weapon, Armor, Magic, and Item Vending
Machines, a free Inn, and a Fat Chocobo!  
			
If you press the A button, the ship can raise itself over mountains for 
short periods of time.  If you have to fight while on the airship, it has 
a cannon that hits all enemies once before the round begins. Exit via the 
ladder, control the ship via the control wheel.

53. Fargabaad

Location: Southwest of Salonia
Treasure:
Enemies:

	This place is located by the Castle.  Use the airship jump ability 
to reach it.  Everything is paladin focused; from the weapons to the low 
level magic.  There is a hidden sage who challenges you under the waterfall, 
and there is a few treasures in the cave; but beware, the duplicating 
enemies are back.  Why do you want to go here?  Because the only
weapon in the game that does NOT duplicate those enemies is the Katana, and 
only the paladin uses it.  Greatly consider promoting your knight to this 
class!

54. Cave of the Leviathan

Location: North of the Living Forest
Treasure: 

Fenixdwn        God'sRage       EarthDrum       Iceblast        
Hipotion x3     Elixir          WScent          Aegis Shield    
LamiaScale      Bacchus' Wine   Shell           Impyawn         
LilithKiss      Thor Hammer     Blkhole         Reflect Armor   Musk

	Above the Living Forest is a weird lake with a strange creature 
swimming in it.  Use the airship jump technique to get near the water, then 
get out and swim to the creature.  You will submerse into an underwater 
maze.  There is a lot of treasure, secret pathways, and if you have somebody 
who can cast call magic, you will fight the enormous Leviathan at the end.

		Leviathan       u/Wave, Bite    5700 GP         2C
		[7000 HP]                       1250 EXP

55. Cave of Bahamut
		
Location: South of the Midget Village
Treasure: 
Enemies:

	Back in the first world, surrounded by mountains, near the viking 
hideout and midget forest.  This is one of the places you could only
see and not go to...until now.

	Use Airship jump again.  The enemies are still pretty tough, but 
they dont duplicate!  This cave is basically full of items like Elixirs,
fenixdwn's, and Godsrage. If you have somebody who can use call magic, 
prepare to fight the infamous Bahamut.

		Bahamut         u/Mega Flare    3500 GP         12C
		[7500 HP]       s/Meteor        700 EXP

56. Cave of Darkness

Location: North of the Water Cave.
Treasure: 
Enemies:  Replicators

		Ok, if you dont have a Paladin or lots of level 99
warriors, youre not going to make it through here.  I would rather have 
a paladin; it takes less time.

Did I say the Ancient Ruins cave was tough?  Think again.  This place makes 
it look like chrono trigger spittle.

		Floor 1:Talk to the Paladin and continue to the
			stairs.  Walk straight through the hidden
			passage.

		Floor 2:The first secret way has treasure.  The
			long passage leads on.  After that,
			take the bottom right secret at the
			end of the second passage.

		Floor 3:Walk past the first two secrets and take
			the first one straight down.  Then
			grab the treasure and take the right secret,
			take the bottom right secret in the first
			zigzag, and the middle secret of the 3 
			lined along the left wall after the next
			secret.

		Floor 4:The Bottom secret on the right wall
			at the end of the passage has a Genji
			Shield. The top passage leads on.

		Floor 5:The immediate right secret leads to
			a Genji Helmet.  The bottom secret to
			the left, followed by the right 
			secret leads on.

		Floor 6:Immediatedly south is the secret 
			leading to Genji Armor.  After that,
			cross the bridge, and ignore the first
			2 secrets.  Take the right wall secret
			when you come upon the last 3.  This will
			lead you to the horn; or rather, the
			pesky paladin who challenges you.  Start 
			whacking away and make sure to use some 
			quake magic.  After the battle, teleport
			out.

57. Statues of the Quest                     

Location: North of Amur
Treasure: None.
Enemies:  None.

	If you've tried to get past these statues before, you know what 
happens.  The only way to get past them is to have the 4 elemental fangs, 
which, if you've been following the walkthrough, you should have by now.



58. Labyrinth of the Ancients & the Crystal Tower

Location: Several Airship jumps from the Statues of the Quest
Treasure:       Musk            Crystal Glove           Crystal Armor
		Crystal Shield  LilithKiss              Crystal Helmet
		Axe ?>?         Fenixdwn                Break Sword
		Total rod (40% chance of petr kill)     Holy Arrow
		Protect Ring    Hell Claw (40% chance of poison)
		Elixir

	When you first came upon the second world, you may have flown over 
a small tower sticking out of the water.  Well, that tower is here, and its 
the focal point for the end of the game.  Walk into the complex and straight 
up through the doorway.  Although the Crystal of Earth sits there waiting, a 
familiar person gangs up on you. (He's a palette swap of the paladin boss
from moments before).  Beat him; fire3 is more effective than quake for this 
battle.  Talk to the crystal to gain 3 more classes!

New Classes:    Black Wizard/White Wizard/Summoner

		Recommendations: 

	1:          Paladin/Karate Master/White Wizard/Black Wizard
	2:          Knight/Paladin/Black Wizard/White Wizard

59. Return to Dorga's House

Location:       South Island Valley near merchant magicians
Treasure:       Curtain of Light x4      20000 GP x2
Enemies:

	As you enter Dorga's House, you hear Dorga and Une calling you!  
	You will automatically enter a maze. Search for treasure 
	(you cant reenter) and look for Dorga and Une by the great 
	waterfall.  As you enter the spot where they are, they challenge 
	you to a fight....for the fate of the world!  The energy that 
	their battle with you would create is enough to let you continue 
	on your quest. The party adamantly refuses to kill their friends, 
	but Dorga and Une give them no choice. Dorga attacks!

		Dorga           u/Quake, Drain
		[4500 HP]
		
		Une             u/Whirl
		[4500 HP]

		If you can beat both, they will slowly die.
		Talk to each person to gain a key. 
		(These are the keys needed to continue your quest!)

60. The Forbidden Land Eureka

Location: Accessed from first floor of Crystal Tower.
Treasure: As Described.
Enemies:  Ninja, Barbarians

	The infamous Crystal Tower is your next stop.
	Unfortunately, it means walking through the Labyrinth of 
	Ancients again, so memorize your way through.

	On the first floor of the Tower is a door directly in
	front of the entrance.  If you enter it, a mysterious
	force pushes you back from going too far.  Press the 
	B button and use the Eureka Key obtained from Dorga.  
	You will automatically enter the Forbidden Land of 
	Eureka.  Loot everything...the best weapons in the 
	game can be found here.

	Boss:     Giant                 unknown
		  [12000 HP]

	Upon entering the door in Floor 7, you will come upon an
	enemy free haven.  To the left and right are healing and 
	revival ponds; to the north is 2 sages.  One informs you
	of something; the other sells magic.  Level 8 magic.  About
	time!!! If you also touch the indent in the wall between
	the two sages, you will open a secret passageway leading
	to a weapons/armor sage.  By talking to the second sage, you
	will gain the final two classes.  Also, if you have defeated
	Odin, Leviathan, or Bahamut, you can buy copies of their magic
	here.

61.     Crystal Tower Continued

Location: Upper Crystal Tower.
Treasure: 
Enemies:  Fire Breathers, Mucus, Magicians

	Get ready!  Be fully stocked up before making the trip.  
	Eventually, you will reach a strange room filled with
	Dragon Statues.  There is a mirror between them.  Walk up
	to the mirror, and an Onionkid will look at you; perhaps
	an image of your past.  As the dragons begin to stir, the
	infamous Dorga will appear out of nowhere and call your 
	friends to the Statues.  

	Amazingly enough, Desh is one of them.  He returns from
	the burning core of the Owen Tower. Dorga is one good magician!
	With your friends blocking the dragons' curse, 
	(Princess Sara, Prince (now King) Alus, one of the 
	Old Men, and Desh), the mirror image will dissapear 
	and you will warp to the final floor of the Crystal Tower.  
	There is no enemies; only the Demon King Zande stands in your way.

	Demon King Zande          u/Meteor        s/Holy, Claws
	[21000 HP]                  Peep          n/Gale
				    Quake         w/Flare
				    Fists [1500]


	Thought that was the end? Think again!  A mysterious light
	is up ahead.  As you walk to it....a monster of epic proportions
	arrives!  I suggest not putting up a fight...She is invincible
	to everything you throw at her.  As soon as she finishes you off,
	your friends will return to you, and give you back your lives,
	HP, and MP.  You will then walk back to the light to find out 
	where the Evil Being has gone!

62.     Final Maze

Location: Top of Crystal Tower 
Treasure: Ribbon Helmet (x4)
Enemies:  Red Ninja, Yellow Dragon, Barbarian

	The game difficulty increases yet again; for there are no save
	spots, healing or revial ponds...or any other luxury.  Your items
	are all that keeps you alive...and there is no escape.

	You are on a dimensional plane of mystery; stars zoom underneath
	you. There are 5 paths; 1 forward and 4 to their respective 
	corners.  If you wish to live; walk one on of the corner routes.

	On each path there are two constants: A treasure chest and
	a Dark Crystal Temple.  Each chest contains a Ribbon Helmet;
	but you must fight Neo-Zande each time.  As for the 
	Temples....they contain 4 of the toughest bosses ever devised!




Upper Left Path:        This is a maze of secret passageways; the correct 
			route is often the farthest from the needed 
			destination.

			Boss:   Death Hound     23000 HP
						6400 G 18C 1500 EXP

Lower Left Path:        This section has a series of vertical passages.
			You can walk through the bottom of any of them,
			and there are 2 secret passages leading to the
			exit and treasure chest.

			Boss:   Plant Fiend     32000 HP
						7000 G 19C 2606 EXP

Upper Right Path:       This is a fairly easy maze, take the top route
			for access to the exit and pathway to the chest.

			Boss:   Yellow Dragon   29000 HP
						6800 G 19C 1750 EXP
						U/Bite [7500+]

Lower Right Path:       This is a long winding path if you dont keep
			a sharp eye.  If you look at the other side
			of the wall to your right, there should be an
			occasional marked secret passage.  Line up with
			it and you can walk through the wall.

			Boss:   Uni-Eye         35000 HP
						7200 G 21C 2250 EXP
	
Upper Middle Path:      This room is a maze.  Certain segments of
			bridge are completely invisible, and as always
			its almost always the piece farthest from that
			leads you to the stairway at the top.

Final Floor:            Load everybody up.  There are no enemies left except
			for the Cloud of Darkness, in the final (and 
			potentially toughest) battle.

			If you managed to save the 4 Dark Warriors, who 
			were in the 4 Dark Crystals, they will reappear 
			and attack the Cloud of Darkness one by one.  This 
			will weaken her so your magic and weapons will work.

63.  The Cloud of Darkness

	&               Battle/Survival Strategies:                  &
	&------------------------------------------------------------&
	&       -Have your White Wizard use -Fast- to accelerate     &
	&        your weapon users. In the case of Paladins, this    &
	&        adds up to 22-30 hits for a total of 4000 damage.   &
	&                                                            &
	&       -Callers should use Bahamut each and every round.    &
	&                                                            &
	&       -Ninja's should be throwing Shuriken each round.     &
	&        The damage quickly becomes the same or better       &
	&        as an accelerated Paladin.                          &
	&                                                            &
	&        -Black Wizards should stick to Flare; Meteor is not &
	&         as effective. If the rest of your party is hurting,&
	&         have your Black Wizard use Elixirs.                &
	&                                                            &
	&        -Sages should be fully equipped, with Bahamut and   &
	&         Cure 4 being a neccessary minimum.  Have them use  &
	&         Bahamut when possible, and Cure4 to help your      &
	&         White Wizard in recovering from Flare Wave.        &
	&                                                            &
	&        -All weapon fighters should be accelerated with     &
	&         fast, and use doubled up weapons:                  &
	&         (Knights: Excalibur/Break)                         &
	&         (Karate Master: Cat Claw/Dragon Claw)              &
	&         (Ninja:  Same as KM or Shuriken x2)                &
	&                                                            &

64.     Finale!         [Ending/Spoiler]

	Upon beating the Cloud of Darkness, and watching her slowly
	melt away, you will return to the Crystal Tower where your
	friends await.  You will hurry back to the Invincible and
	fly away.  

	Now, you will drop off your friends.

	-The old man is returned to his group in Amur.
	-King Alus is returned to his Castle of Salonia.
	-Cid and Desh are returned to the family in Canaan. 
	 Sarina (the formerly sick girl) and Desh are finally reunited.       
  
	    Now, the party and Sara are alone, and finally return through 
	the Valley of the Nelb into the zone surrouned by the Palmeni 
	Mountains...the Kingdom of Sasun. But, Sara doesn't want to leave 
	her friends the Light Warriors just yet...she whines, and they are
	convinced to go back to Ul instead of taking Princess Sara home 
	to Sasun Castle. When you arrive at Ul, Sara urges the party 
	to go up to the circle of their fellow townspeople who are 
	waiting eagerly.

	Suddenly, the ground begins to shake!  Everyone looks to the
	Sky north of Ul...to the Altar Cave...

	The brilliant light of the Wind Crystal shines, as it comes back 
	from underground, returning the power of light to the people of 
	the world.  The overhead screen shows the lush color returning 
	to the landscape. Now, it is finally dawn again.

	The screen cuts to space, with a poem: (roughly translated)

	"However, something was missing from life.
	 The light and darkness split apart
	 Holding the light, they made the world shine
	 using the force called "hope".
	 Time Teaches All; Dream, Despair, Love,
	 However, If they do not accept,
	 If they never look back,
	 They must not cry"


	Stars begin to pass by at increasing speeds until it all blacks
	out.

	Finally, the credits begin to display.  Each credit is
	accompanied by each class in the game, one by one.  

	As almost always in FF...the game ends with a star field and
	and the words....THE END.
	
	Congratulations on beating Final Fantasy III!
