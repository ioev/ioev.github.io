ABOUT THE GAME
=========================================================================

This game's actual title is 'EarthBound', but for sake of clarity, most
people are referring to it as 'EarthBound Zero'.  There are several
versions of this game on the Internet--the one I'm using includes a
patch to prevent the 'illegal copy' screen that appears in various
parts of the game.  I'd like to thank Demi and all the others who helped
to release this game for all us EB fanatics to play.  Concerning this
FAQ, well, it's a Mini-FAQ.  I'm not going to get all the monster's
stats or anything like that because frankly, it's too time-consuming.
If someone wants to contribute anything, they get props, of course, but
this is just sort of like a quick help guide and not some definitive
walkthrough.

You need to have a NES emulator (such as Nesticle), to play this game as
well as the ROM file itself.  You can get the ROM at Neo Demiforce
(http://shell.cdc.net/~loiosh/demi/) and Nesticle at Zophar's Domain
(http://zophar.malicia.com) under the NES Emulator section.  If you have
a FAQ question, ask away, but don't ask me to send you the EBZ file or
anything like that because I won't.

This FAQ has spoilers (there's no way around it), so read at your own
risk.

         damage taken by about half.
 Run   - Your character will attempt to run away.  You cannot run away
         from boss battles.


 SOME ADVICE  ___________________________________________________________

  - You can save your game by calling your Dad, either using a phone in
    a healer's house or your home, or by using a pay phone.  It costs
    one dollar to use a pay phone.  If you have a Phone Card (refer to
    the walkthrough), you can use a pay phone even when you're broke,
    and the amount will be deducted from your bank account.  Note that
    your dad will sometimes contact you in the middle of the game and
    offer to save your game for you.

  - If you have more items than space, you can always store them in your
    closet at home.  Talk to Minnie at your house and she'll hold onto
    any items you want.  To get them back, just ask her to give you back
    an item.

  - If you die and continue, you lose half the money you were currently
    carrying on you.


=========================================================================
BASIC WALKTHROUGH
=========================================================================

 - Once the game begins, attack the lamp when it comes after you.

 - Then go into your sister's room and attack the doll.  Examine it
   afterwards to hear one of the eight songs you'll need to memorize
   later.

 - Talk to your mother, then to your father.  Go outside and check your
   dog to get the Basement Key.  Get the items from the basement.

 - Now spend some time building up levels, preferrably until you reach
   Level 3.  Go to Podunk and buy the Canary Chick from the department
   store.  Also, look for the man giving a survey--you can get a Phone
   Card from him.

 - Head northwest to the Canary Village.  There's a hole in the wall
   behind the gray statue, so go behind it and use the chick on the
   talking canary, Laura.  She'll sing another melody to you.  Now
   return to town and and talk to the Mayor.  Agree to help him.

 - Make your way to the south of town, and watch out for people who are
   really Pseudo Zombies.  At the graveyard, look for an open crypt (it's
   east of the church).  In the adjoining room at the bottom, open the
   coffin on the far left to find Pippi.

 - Return with Pippi to the town.  If she faints, you'll have to revive
   her in the hospital.  Then go talk to the Mayor, get the Zoo Key from
   Abbot, and head back to your house.

 - Along the way, pick up the Franklin Badge from Pippi.  Save your game
   and return to town.  Look for the path that leads north to the Zoo.

 - After the Singing Monkey steals your key at the Zoo gates, go inside.
   Head east until you reach the Superindent's building.  Go inside and
   get all the goods.

 - On the top floor, enter the right-hand door first and get the Life Up
   Cream.  Then go into the left door and examine the capsule.

 - Starman Jr. will appear.  This battle is easier than it looks, esp. if
   you have the Franklin Badge, which reflects Gamma Beams.

 - Once Starman leaves, you may want to go and heal up back in the town.
   Don't forget to get another song from the Singing Monkey at the Zoo,
   though.  Return to the upper bridge where the guards are (northeast
   of the Zoo), and they'll let you past.

 - In the cave, examine the stone and then use 'Telepathy'.  You'll be
   warped to the land of dreams, Magicant.

 - One man here will give you an Ocarina, and another one will give you
   a Big Bag (full of Magic Herbs) if you let him borrow your Cash Card
   for a while.

 - You can withdraw (but not deposit) money by going to Mary's Fountain
   and using Telepathy, if you need some extra dough.

 - Leave the town and head northeast.  To answer the man who tells
   riddles, use 'Telepathy' after he finishes talking.  In Mary's
   castle, talk to everyone.  One room has six chests--open one and the
   rest close.  I suggest getting the Boomerang.

 - When you're done here, leave and look for the Flying Men's home.  You
   can have one of these guys accompany you and fight for you, but if
   they die, you'll have to go get another one.  There's a limited number
   of Flying Men, so don't waste 'em.  If you want to build up EXP fast,
   look for the Grouchos and wait for them to leave.  They'll usually
   give one character lots of EXP whereas if you beat them, you only get
   a few measly points.

 - Go to the Fountain.  Heed the advice of the men there and return to
   the town, then go east.  There are a bunch of wells here.  From the
   well across the bridge, go south and step on the well slightly to
   the left of the first well you come across.

 - It leads into a dungeon, which is actually quite short.  Keep trying
   the different holes and ladders until you reach the bottom floor.
   You can't do anything to the Dragon right now, but don't miss the
   hole that leads to the room with the Onyx Hook.

 - Take it and go find the Forgotten Man (northeast of the hole).  Tell
   him that you'll ignore him, and he disappears.  Step through the
   door behind him and you'll appear in a new cave.  Leave, and you'll
   be outside.  The Onyx Hook is a very valuable item.  It works at
   any time, so if you are in a dungeon with little goods or PP left
   and no way to get out, you might as well use the Hook to return to
   Magicant (getting to the well dungeon and getting through it becomes
   easier as you keep playing, so it's not like it takes a long time to
   return to the real world).

 - Go north until you find a path that leads down to the ground.  Then
   keep going north to arrive at Merryville.

 - The Twinkle School is nearby.  Talk to the janitor and he'll open the
   door on the top floor.  Examine the garbage can to find your second
   friend.

 - Leave and go south to the Little-Sweet Factory.  Look for a ladder
   that leads up; it'll set you on the right path.  The Bottle Rocket
   you need is in a garbage can.

 - Once you have the rocket, return to your pal and he'll join you.
   After he destroys the lab by accident, you should get him some
   weapons and armor (a Boomerang from this town, and if you have
   the money, a Magic Coin and Gold Ring from Magicant).  You'll want
   to raise him _lots_ of levels, up to at least 12 or higher.  When
   you're ready, walk to the north and head west of the train tracks,
   then north again.  You'll find a Pass on the ground.  Keep going and
   you'll arrive at Duncan Factory.

 - Show the dog your Pass, then defeat it.  Inside the factory, you
   need to make your way to the upper-left corner of the building.
   You'll know when you're on the right track when you reach a long
   hall that goes far to the left, then diagonally down for some
   distance.  Launch the rocket in the bay, then leave.

 - You can now go past the boulders to the Union Station.  From here,
   there are a lot of places to go to--what I'm listing is what I did.

 - Go to Reindeer.  A woman there will give you the girl's hat.  Several
   people in this town have the flu, so be careful who you talk to.
   One man will also give you lots of money--but I don't know what
   happens if you hold onto it.  Don't forget to buy the Plasma Beam
   from the top floor of the department store--it's the best weapon you
   can give to your friend.  Although it breaks after only a few uses,
   you should keep one handy in case you get into a sticky situation.

 - Go to Snowman.  Note that if you visit the Healer's house, the main
   character's Dad will want to know your (yes, _your_) name.  Visit
   the Snowman Chateau and show the girl the hat, and she'll join you.
   You should raise her level to at least 10.  This is very easy
   considering that you can sleep for free at the Chateau.  At this
   point, I suggest using the Onyx Hook to return to Magicant, so you
   can get that Magic Ribbon for her from the ground-swimming cat, as
   well as some Magic Coins and Gold Rings for anyone who still doesn't
   have them.  As for weapons, don't get her a Frying Pan from Snowman,
   get her a Boomerang from Merryville.

 - Now return to the Union Station and go to Spookane.  This town is
   filled with monsters.  Feel free to stay at the hotel if you want,
   but you'll be attacked by a Starman the day after.  In the actual
   town (where everyone lives outdoors), one woman will give you the
   key to the Rosemary's house.  From the room with the mouse, take the
   upper door, then keep taking the lower door.  This will eventually
   lead you to the piano room.  Check out the piano to learn another one
   of the melodies Queen Mary wanted you to find.

 - Now leave the house and return to the Union Station.  Head east, and
   go up into the cliffs to get around the broken bridge.  You'll end
   up in the Yucca Desert.  Be sure to find the singing cactus (you can
   tell which one it is because it has a face).  From the war survivor's
   tent (see below), head west, then north.  Use 'Telepathy' on the
   cactus and he'll sing one of the melodies you need.

 - In the desert, you may run into a war survivor.  If you ride his plane
   10 times (or since you have 3 people, 4 times), he'll let you ride his
   tank (use the stubs on him).  However, you can't take it beyond the
   desert.  There's some ruins in the desert to the east of the war guy's
   tent--however, the ruins are guarded by a powerful robot.  To defeat
   it, get in the tank and pilot it up into the area where the robot
   appears.  He'll attack you, but the tank will reflect any damage
   taken.  If you haven't already found the singing cactus, try riding
   Flight Plan A to see where it is.

 - After the robot is dead, you can explore the rest of the ruins (but
   the tank will break).  A hole here leads down into an area where
   many monkeys live.  At least one monkey gives you a Speed Capsule;
   otherwise, you can get PSI Stones from the presents scattered
   throughout the area.  On the bottommost floor is a pink structure.
   If you use Telepathy, it will take you to Magicant.  Note that if
   you leave Magicant via the well dungeon, you'll end up near
   Youngtown instead of south from Merrysville.

 - Make your way to Youngtown.  Here, look for the Garrickson's house
   and use 'Telepathy' on the baby to learn Teleport.  Then head to the
   east and go into the swamp area.

 - Keep heading northeast.  After crossing a couple of bridges, you'll
   reach a house.  Inside is Pippi, who will let you stay the night.
   Since you can sleep here for free, you might as well bash some
   monsters and raise some levels.  In the trashcan outside the house
   is the weakling's father, who will check to make sure that you've
   registered your real name.

 - When you're ready to move on, keep heading southwest.  Tougher
   monsters, like Crocodiles and Mooks will show up, so be careful.
   After a while, you'll be able to head due east, so keep doing that
   until you arrive at the forest.  Go north from here and make your
   way to Ellay.

 - Be careful who you talk to in Ellay (get it?  L.A.?  Anyway....),
   because some of them are Bla-Bla Gang members and will attack you.
   Look around town if you want, then head to the northwest to the
   Look-Out Tower.  Go to the top floor and examine the far left
   telescope to make a rocket land.  You can take it to a small island.
   On the island, you can trade Strawberry Tofu with the three
   inhabitants to get the Words O' Love (from the scientist), the
   Swear Words (from Able), or some information about a robot in Mt.
   Itoi (from Baker).  If you don't have any berry tofu, you can buy
   it in Reindeer for $975 per piece.

 - Now, go to the building where the Live Show is at.  Since you need
   a ticket, buy one in the Department Store for $350 (there's a man
   outside the show building who is selling his for $1200, so ignore
   him).  Once inside, tell the man you want to dance.  When you're
   done, your fourth friend shows up.  If you tell him you beat up his
   gang, he'll fight you, but call it quits after a few rounds.  He'll
   kick out your friend (the guy who everyone thinks is a weakling),
   and join the party.  Don't bother buying armor from Magicant for
   this guy as he's already plenty powerful.  BTW, remember the cop who
   says he can hook you up with weapons?  If you buy a drink from the
   girl in the Live Show, you'll get arrested, and your main character's
   item will be confiscated.  You'll have to buy it back if you want it
   (in another words, his 'powerful weapon' is just whatever gets
   confiscated).

 - With him in your party, head east, then south, go across the river,
   and keep going east.  There's a house in a clearing where you can heal
   up.  North of that is a cavern.  The cavern maze in itself is not very
   tricky; just remember what door leads where and you can find the exit
   fairly soon.  Don't forget to get Hank's Bat for your main character,
   the Iron Skillet for your girlfriend, and the Katana for the new guy,
   as you explore the maze.

 - Outside, make your way to the northeast.  You can climb up the long
   ropes hanging from the tree stumps.  There's a boat to the north that
   you can't use, so look for a healer's house instead.  He can heal
   and revive anyone.  After saving your game, you can dance with your
   girlfriend in the other room.  You'll be attacked by a robot that
   you can't defeat afterward.  When you come to, talk to your pal.
   He's too injured to keep fighting (maybe he's dead?), so your buddy
   who got kicked out will join instead.

   NOTE: At some point you need to return to Magicant and kill the
   dragon in the well dungeon who's sleeping (remember him?)  I don't
   know when you can do this (I didn't do it until later), but I think
   that around now, you're powerful enough to wake him up.

 - Go back through the cave and return to the healer's house to rest up,
   then go north to where the broken boat was.  Your friend can fix it
   up and make it usable.  Find the whirlpool in the middle of the ocean,
   and pilot it inside.

 - Inside the submarine, take the elevator down and head all the way to
   the left.  Climb up the ladder you find and check the robot.  It will
   awaken, then the submarine will explode.

 - Back on land, you need to head northeast.  Note that you cannot use
   the Onyx Hook while Eve is in your party.  However, she will attack
   first every round and do in excess of 900 points of damage, so feel
   free to take some time to raise levels.  In any case, shortly after
   finding the Sea Pendant, you'll be attacked by a robot that will
   destroy Eve.  Check Eve's body to hear another one of the eight
   songs, then keep heading north.  There's a gravestone here that will
   teach you the final song.

 - Beyond it is a blocked cave.  At this point, I returned to Magicant
   to fight the dragon.  I honestly don't know if I could have fought
   it at an earlier point.  Anyway, use the Onyx Hook to return to
   Magicant.  Leave via the well dungeon, but on your way out, stop and
   check the dragon.  It will wake up and attack you.  Use PSI Block and
   the dragon will be hecka easy to kill.  When it's dead, talk to it to
   get another musical note.

 - You should now have all eight notes.  Return to Magicant (you can use
   the Onyx Hook even in the well dungeon).  Remember the guitar player
   who wanted you to come visit him?  When your Level is high enough,
   he'll tell you his secret (which, BTW, is a reminder of where all the
   melodies are if you missed one).  Yes, this does have to do with your
   level (he kept telling me the same message, then my friend rose a
   level and he changed it), which IMHO is a little stupid because you'll
   have all the notes by then anyway....

 - When you're ready to continue, go meet with Queen Mary.

 - BEFORE you talk to her, keep in mind that if you do so, you can never
   return to Magicant.

 - She'll tell you about Giegue (I'll give you one guess who that is...
   he may be more familiar to you SNES Earthbound players as Giygas).
   Then, you'll be warped back to the gravestone south of the blocked
   cave.  Go north and you'll find that you can now get inside.

 - In one of the side passages is a room full of people, all of whom
   were kidnapped (including Erika's parents and the citizens of
   Youngtown).  Talk to them, then leave and continue north.  Go through
   the cave at the north end of the path, and you'll find the Mother
   Ship waiting for you, as well as Giegue.

 - I highly recommend that your main character knows LifeUp Beta, and
   your girlfriend knows LifeUp Pi.  It'll really help.  Your characters
   should keep guarding and healing themselves until Giegue finishes
   his monologue.  Then, start singing.  You'll need to sing lots of
   times (eight, maybe nine times), so make sure that you keep your life
   up.  Having some extra LifeUp Creams and PSI Stones on hand will help
   if your PP levels begin to drop too low.

CHEATS AND TRICKS
=========================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
MONEY GLITCH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, apparently this isn't really a glitch.  According to Zach Bertram,
whatever money you get from killing monsters already appears on your
card (i.e, you don't need to talk to your Dad to get it, you can just
take it from an ATM).  So if you spend a bunch of money, _then_ call
your Dad, he tells you how much you earned, but the amount of money
is actually whatever you had already spent.  It looks weird, but it
actually makes sense (I guess).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
HELP AVOID ATTACKS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every time you leave a battle, a certain amount of steps is chosen by
the computer.  After you walk so many steps, you'll be attacked again.
However, if you open up your menu window, the number of steps is
re-determined.  This is great for us emulator users, as you can just
save your state, take a couple of steps, and if you get attacked, reload
your state, open your menu, and try again to see if you can go further
without getting attacked.  Although useful, remember that if you don't
fight monsters, you won't earn money or be able to level-up.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET THE MOST OUT OF RAISING LEVELS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every time you see the message '(somebody) has raised a level', save your
state.  This is because the stats. that are raised are chosen at random
each time, so if you only get minor increases in your scores, then just
reload your state and see if you get something better the next time
around.  You can also try to 'force' a new skill by reloading your state
repeatedly until your character earns a Psychic Power.


=========================================================================
PSYCHIC POWER CHART
=========================================================================

Psychic Powers are learned through fighting.  While you learn the
majority of them through level-up, you can also earn them simply by going
into a battle, even if you run away from the battle.

Revision History  _______________________________________________________

 Version 0.6  (July 28, 1998)
  - Just a note that I lost all my EB save files :(  So I don't really
    know if this guide will be updated any more, or at least, it won't
    be until I play through the game again.

 Version 0.5  (June 24, 1998)
  - Some PSI information and other stuff.  I'll finish up the PK list
    by the next update, so don't worry about the ??'s for now.

 Version 0.4  (June 8, 1998)
  - More corrections and additions.

 Version 0.3  (May 12, 1998)
  - Added more general information.

 Version 0.2  (May 8, 1998)
  - Finished the walkthrough and added several lists.

 Version 0.1  (April 30, 1998)
  - Basic walkthrough.

Questions  ______________________________________________________________

 - There's a store in Magicant that needs the Ocarina.  You can get it
   from a man also in Magicant.  Can you give it to the shopkeeper
   somehow?
 - Has anyone found the single mine that the war survivor buried in the
   Yucca Desert?  What's the point of finding it?
