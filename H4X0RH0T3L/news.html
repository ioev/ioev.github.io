Really quick update.  I added the new version of ZDspc, get it in the "archive" section.  I also
changed/removed some links.  Some of them are currently bad but I'll wait and see if they fix themselves.<BR>

<P><B>February 8, 1999</B><BR>
I finished up the last two animated Breath of Fire 2 gifs for the "stuff" section as well as made
a new title banner thing.  I also put up a new link "button", for linking to me... if you want to.<BR>

<P><B>February 4, 1999</B><BR>
-Changed the "what's new" graphic, different.<BR>
-Added a new link to the "links" section.<BR>
-Various cosmetic changes.<BR>

<P><B>February 3, 1999</B><BR>
-Updated 2 Breath of Fire 2 gifs as animated gifs (Nina2 and Spar3)<BR>
-Updated the Dracula X page with the level 3 secrets.<BR>

<P><B>February 1, 1999</B><BR>
As you may have noticed, this is now know as the "What's new" section and not the "news" section.  I realized
that what I was posting was not news (for the most part).  I also added some funky html stuff to make the links cooler, I
guess.  There are 2 new animated gifs from Breath of Fire 2 in the stuff section and I fixed the time warp.  In my updates
I had put the year for all of January as 1998.  The ammount of "what's new" is now limited to 5 updates.<BR>

<P><B>January 28, 1999</B><BR>
Quick update.  Replaced 3 of the Breath of Fire 2 gifs in the "stuff" section with animated gifs.  Changed
the "hr" tag into a graphic of a line (netscape couldn't display colored horizontal rules).  Replaced some of the
section title graphics, and added a link to the "links" section.  Enjoy.<BR>
BTW:  Any gifs on this page (ones which are not part of the page design) can be used freely on your site, as long as it's
not for commercial purposes or for one of those "10000 gifs" pages.  Try to give some credit though...<BR>

<P><B>January 25, 1999</B><BR>
Well, at least I got something done.  Check out the <A HREF=stuff/stuff.html>stuff</A> section to see my
first 2 animated gifs.  The first one is the Actraiser guy and the second is Kiddy Kong, from DKC3.  Bleh.<BR>

<P><B>January 18, 1999</B><BR>
Being how I've been ever so unproductive, I've updated the links section.  I'll be getting back on track
once I get my computer set up.  (I know it's a bad excuse)  I just had the processor replaced and I just recently
formatted it.  Bleh.<BR>

<P><B>January 4, 1999</B><BR>
Well, my updates few and far between.  This is still because of my computer not being set up.  So for the sake of
being productive, I made a new mod (in the archive) and added the newest version of ZDspc (version 1.71).  I also
added a few links in the links section.  Good night.<BR>

<P><B>December 25, 1998</B><BR>
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!<BR>
Well, it's time for a Christmas update, and a very merry Christmas it is.  For the sake of gloating, I gots myself a Gameboy Color.
It ownz.  Also got a whole bunch of other cool stuff.  As a final joyous present, I just noticed that the new zSNES was released!  So
go get it from the archive!  Now!!<BR>

<P><B>December 20, 1998</B><BR>
Quick update for the reason that I had nothing to do.  Added another mod to the archive.  Secret of Mana... oooohhhhh<BR>

<P><B>December 17, 1998</B><BR>
This update is dedicated to GeechyGuy (Joey)<BR>
I know I haven't updated in a while.  This is all because of my new computer and my lack of resources.  But anyway, here goes... 
I added spcAMP 0.401 to the archive section as well as three mods (one of them is older).  I'll try to make a few regularily.<BR>

<P><B>December 7, 1998</B><BR>
Talk about lack of updates.  This is mainly because of me getting a new PC, so I still have to set it up and get my page on the Hard
Drive.  Expect a whole lot more from me including animated gifs, lots of mods, and a whole bunch more!  Also in this update:  2 updates of SPC
players and one new SPC player.  Get them at in the ARCHIVE!  (I also removed the EB spcs, get em at ZD)<BR>

<P><B>November 30, 1998</B><BR>
Another update to the Dracula X section.  I added a few secrets and added the "Stage 2" section.  Also added something to the reviews
section so that it doesn't just give you an error when you click on the link.  I'm also looking into having submissions to this section (as in,
people can submit their own reviews).  This could be of anything really, games, music, movies, etc.  Just E-mail me.<BR>

<P><B>November 23, 1998</B><BR>
HUGE update to the <A HREF=dracx/dracx.html>DraculaX</A> section (told you that I'd work on it).  I now just thought about how cool it would
be if people actually came to this site.  Hmmmm...  The sidebar was also drastically modified for the new sections (and sections to come).  The reviews
section has not been completed yet.<BR>

<P><B>November 17, 1998</B><BR>
Well that was fun.  A whole week where I could not update.  Well, in this update I replaced a bad zip of GENecyst
and added another Genesis emulator, KGen98.  I also removed the Breath of Fire II .spc's (the entire soundtrack is on ZD).
Expect to see a DraculaX section soon.  I just go my hands on it and want to put up some screenshots, secrets, etc.<BR>

<P>Ahhh... back at home once again.  I've uploaded a little preview of the Dracula X section.  Not much there though.  If
you want to see it then click right <A HREF=dracx/dracx.html>here</A>.

<P><B>November 10, 1998</B><BR>
Wow, my webpage actually had downtime, that's a first.  Anyway, while I wasn't able to update my page, a new
SPC player came out from the people responsible for Zsnes and SPCplay, it's called SPCamp.  It's merely a simple winamp
plug-in that let's you play SPC's, and it r0x0rs.  Especially due to the fact that you can load more than 1 spc at a time.<BR>
I also removed all the spc packs that are duplicates of stuff at Zophar's Domain (Need the space).<BR>

<P><B>November 4, 1998</B><BR>
Wow, it's November.  Well, I guess I haven't been updating lately, been busy doing other things.  One of them being
<A HREF=y2k/index.html TARGET=_top>this</A>.  It's under construction so you can't do much yet.  Also, I fixed a few minor things
on the page.  You probably won't notice them.  Might update the links section later today.<BR>

<P><B>October 27, 1998</B><BR>
Another version of zsnes was released with various bugfixes.  Version 0.715 is availiable in the archive section.
Also, I've been pretty sick lately so I haven't been very productive.  There's a couple of new links in the links section.

<P><B>October 23, 1998</B><BR>
Well, I haven't been doing much lately so I don't have anyting to add to the site.  I noticed that my counter went down
a couple of days ago.  I think it was just the counter service I was on decided to stop giving out that service.  Anyway, screw
counters.<BR>

<P><B>October 20, 1998</B><BR>
Minor cosmetic enhancements.  Small addition of gifs to the "stuff" section.  Also added my ICQ UIN at the bottom of this page.<BR>
Also, I've gotten into making title graphics, etc.  So if you are in need of one, just e-mail me with your site and I'll see what I can do!<BR>

<P><B>October 18, 1998</B><BR>
Major update to the "stuff" section.   I added a whole bunch of new .gis's for Rockman & Forte.<BR>
Also updated the links section, expect a whole bunch of new links pretty soon.<BR>

<P>Later that day...<BR>
I got bored, so I redid the whole site.  (Pretty much).  I got sick of the old font, fake 3d-ish graphics, and purple/navy blue colors.<BR>
E-mail me with your thoughts.<BR>

<P><B>October 17, 1998</B><BR>
Quick update, added the new version of Winspc.  Go get it, it's cool.  (Although it can't play anything on my p75).<BR>

<P><B>October 16, 1998</B><BR>
Big update to the <A HREF=archive.html TARGET=main>archive</A> section.  Added 50 spc files!<BR>
...that's pretty much all... for now...<BR>

<P><B>October 12, 1998</B><BR>
Minor update...  I added H4X0Ramp, my first Winamp skin.  (Which took forever to make I may add).<BR>
You can find it in the <A HREF=stuff/stuff.html>stuff</A> section.<BR>

<P><B>October 11, 1998</B><BR>
Been updating little things over the past few days.  New RF graphics and gifs of all the characters in Breath of Fire 2.<BR>
Removed a dead link.  ('tis sad indeed)<BR>

<P><B>October 7, 1998</B><BR>
Changed around a whole lot of stuff.  Added a bunch of game gifs and a new section (stuff).<BR>
E-mail me and tell me what to put on my site, I'm running out of ideas!<BR>

<P><B>October 5, 1998</B><BR>
Added a map I made of the Sewers in Parasite Eve.  It's right <A HREF=archive/pemap.jpg>here</A>.<BR>
If you want to use it on your site, or for a walkthrough or something, just E-mail me.<BR>
Also, I was thinking of mapping out other part of the game, mabye even the entire game itself.<BR>
Mail me!<BR>
<P>Added WinSPC, a windows SPC player.  Get it in the archive section.<BR>
Almost finished of my "H4X0Ramp" Winamp skin.  Expect it within the week.<BR>

<P><B>October 1, 1998</B><BR>
Changed around a few things.  Zophar's Domain has moved... it's new location is <A HREF=www.zophar.net TARGET="_top">www.zophar.net</A><BR>
Minor update to the Earthbound Zero and Final Fantasy IIIj pages.  Also changed the guide around a bit.<BR>

<P><B>September 27, 1998</B><BR>
A minor update.  I added a Secret of Mana .spc file due to a request<BR>
Greets goes out to Moik!<BR>

<P><B>September 24, 1998</B><BR>
As you may have noticed, the layout and graphics have changed.  I decided that a nice imagemap would be nice for the place and also, the old graphics were looking pretty crappy.<BR>
I also finished making a new spc pack.  It's full of Final Fantasy 4 music.  Joy.<BR>

<P><B>September 21, 1998</B><BR>
Decided to add a couple of emu's to make your visit worthwhile<BR>
While you're here, you might as well sign my guestbook... and send me some mail!<BR>

<P><B>September 20, 1998</B><BR>
I am now set up on xoom.  I hope this works out better than it did at geocities.<BR>
If you want to know, I will be working on the site a bit, putting up some "game specific" area's.<BR>
